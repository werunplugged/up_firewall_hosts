# UP Phone Firewall - Hosts Blocking Component
## High-Performance Hosts Controller for OS-Level Privacy Protection

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL--3.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## 🛡️ Overview

This repository contains the **Hosts resolution control module** of the UP Phone Firewall (Liberty Firewall) system - a critical component that provides high-performance, OS-level privacy protection by intercepting and blocking unwanted tracker domains at the DNS level.

This hosts blocking component operates at the heart of the firewall's protection mechanism, replacing the traditional `/etc/hosts` file approach with a sophisticated, memory-optimized blocking system that supports wildcard domains and handles over 100,000 (and can support millions) blocking rules efficiently. As the primary line of defense in the firewall system, this module ensures that tracking attempts are stopped at the DNS resolution stage before any network connections can be established.

### Key Benefits of this DNS Blocking Module

- **🚀 High Performance**: O(1) domain lookups with optimized hash tables
- **🎯 Wildcard Support**: Block entire domain families with leading dot (e.g., `.tracker.com` blocks all subdomains)
- **💾 Memory Efficient**: Shared pointer architecture reduces memory usage
- **🔄 Hot Reload**: Automatic blocklist updates without service restart
- **🔒 Thread Safe**: Lock-free reads with concurrent access support
- **🔋 Battery Saving**: Reduces network traffic and extends battery life
- **📊 Zero Overhead**: Native Linux implementation with no additional processes
- **🔗 System Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the broader firewall infrastructure

## 🏗️ Architecture

### System Design

This hosts blocking module serves as a key component in the UP Phone Firewall system, operating at the DNS resolution layer to provide the first line of defense against tracking attempts. The module intercepting domain lookups before network connections are established, working in conjunction with other firewall protection mechanisms.

The implementation is a singleton C++ class that integrates directly with Android's `getaddrinfo()` system call, ensuring all DNS queries pass through this filtering layer:

```

### Core Components

- **BlocklistManager**: Singleton class managing the blocklist
- **BlockEntry**: Lightweight structure storing redirect addresses
- **FileInfo**: Tracks blocklist file changes with nanosecond precision
- **Address Pool**: Deduplicates common redirect addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Structures

```cpp
// Main blocklist storage - O(1) lookups
std::unordered_map<std::string, BlockEntry> blocklist;

// Memory optimization through address pooling
std::unordered_map<std::string, std::shared_ptr<std::string>> addressPool;

// Thread-safe access with reader-writer locks
mutable std::shared_mutex rwMutex;
```

### Key Algorithms

#### Two-Phase Domain Matching

1. **Exact Match**: Direct hash table lookup for the full domain name
2. **Wildcard Match**: Progressive parent domain checking with leading dot notation

```cpp
// How it works:
// - Entry "tracker.com" → blocks ONLY "tracker.com" (exact match)
// - Entry ".tracker.com" → blocks ALL subdomains: "ads.tracker.com", "analytics.tracker.com", etc.

// Example lookup for "ads.analytics.tracker.com":
// 1. Check exact: "ads.analytics.tracker.com" (not found)
// 2. Check wildcard: ".analytics.tracker.com" (not found)
// 3. Check wildcard: ".tracker.com" (BLOCKED if in list)
// 4. Check wildcard: ".com" (checked but unlikely to be blocked)
```

#### File Stability Detection

The implementation uses a clever double-stat mechanism to ensure blocklist files aren't being actively written:

```cpp
bool isFileStable() {
    struct stat stat1, stat2;
    stat(blocklistPath.c_str(), &stat1);
    usleep(1000); // 1ms delay
    stat(blocklistPath.c_str(), &stat2);

    return (stat1.st_size == stat2.st_size &&
            stat1.st_mtim.tv_sec == stat2.st_mtim.tv_sec &&
            stat1.st_mtim.tv_nsec == stat2.st_mtim.tv_nsec);
}
```

### Performance Characteristics

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Exact Domain Lookup | O(1) | - |
| Wildcard Lookup | O(d) where d = domain depth | - |
| Blocklist Reload | O(n) where n = entries | O(n) |
| Concurrent Reads | Lock-free | - |

## 📋 What Gets Blocked by This DNS Module

### Blocked Categories

- **📊 Analytics Services**: Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Adobe Analytics
- **🎯 Ad Networks**: DoubleClick, AdMob, Facebook Audience Network
- **👁️ Tracking Pixels**: Facebook Pixel, Twitter tracking, LinkedIn Insight
- **📱 Third-party SDKs**: Crash reporters, attribution trackers, telemetry
- **🕷️ Cross-app Trackers**: Branch, AppsFlyer, Adjust
- **⚠️ Known Malicious Domains**: Phishing sites, malware distribution

### What Remains Allowed

- ✅ **First-party content**: Direct app/website functionality
- ✅ **CDN Resources**: Legitimate content delivery (CloudFlare, AWS S3)
- ✅ **Essential Services**: Core functionality required for apps to work

## 🔐 Privacy Impact of DNS-Level Blocking

### Ad Intelligence (AdInt) Risk Mitigation

This hosts blocking module specifically targets Ad Intelligence operations that build comprehensive user profiles across apps and websites. By intercepting these domains at the DNS level, this component prevents:

- Behavioral profiling
- Cross-app data correlation
- Location tracking through ads
- Device fingerprinting
- Interest graph construction

### Real-World Examples

**Spotify Protection**: While allowing music streaming, the firewall blocks:
- Firebase Analytics (`firebase-settings.crashlytics.com`)
- Branch attribution (`api.branch.io`)
- Facebook Analytics (`graph.facebook.com`)

**Web Browsing**: Blocks third-party trackers while loading main content:
- Faster page loads (up to 40% improvement)
- Reduced data usage (average 25% reduction)
- Enhanced privacy (blocks 100+ trackers per session)

## 🚀 Installation & Integration

### Prerequisites

- Android AOSP build environment
- C++17 compatible compiler
- Android NDK (for standalone builds)

### Integration Steps

1. **Add BlocklistManager.h to your project**
```bash
cp BlocklistManager.h /path/to/aosp/bionic/libc/dns/
```

2. **Modify getaddrinfo.cpp**
```cpp
#include "BlockListManager.h"

static bool files_getaddrinfo(const char* name, ...) {
    auto [isBlocked, targetAddress] =
        BlocklistManager::getInstance().checkDomain(name);

    if (isBlocked) {
        // Redirect to targetAddress (typically 0.0.0.0)
        return getaddrinfo_numeric(targetAddress.c_str(), ...);
    }
    // Continue with normal resolution
}
```

3. **Configure blocklist path**
```cpp
// Default path: /data/etc/hosts
// IMPORTANT: Must use a path outside the system partition for dynamic updates
BlocklistManager::getInstance("/data/etc/hosts");
```

**⚠️ Important Android Configuration Requirements:**
- The blocklist file should be stored outside the normal partition (e.g., `/data/etc/hosts`) to allow runtime updates
- System partition is read-only and cannot be modified after boot
- Additional OS modifications required such as
  - SELinux policy updates
  - File permissions configuration

### Blocklist Format

```
# Standard hosts file format

# Exact domain blocking (blocks ONLY this specific domain)
0.0.0.0 tracker.example.com
0.0.0.0 ads.example.com

# Wildcard blocking with leading dot (blocks ALL subdomains)
0.0.0.0 .doubleclick.net          # Blocks: ads.doubleclick.net, stats.doubleclick.net, etc.
0.0.0.0 .google-analytics.com     # Blocks: www.google-analytics.com, ssl.google-analytics.com, etc.

# Note: Without the leading dot, only exact matches are blocked
0.0.0.0 facebook.com              # Blocks ONLY facebook.com, NOT www.facebook.com
0.0.0.0 .facebook.com             # Blocks ALL subdomains of facebook.com
```
